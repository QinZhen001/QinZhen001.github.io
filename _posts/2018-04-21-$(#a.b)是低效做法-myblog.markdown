jQuery选择器优化问题，使用$('#a>.b')，IDE会提示这是低效的用法

It suggests to split descendant selectors which are prefaced with ID selector and warns about duplicated selectors which could be cached.

```
$("#property [data-role='content'] .container");

Changing it to this makes PhpStorm happy and can evidently be more than twice as fast:

$("#property").find("[data-role='content'] .container");
```
